### Hi, my name is Natasha ðŸ‘‹

# About me
I'm Nat, and I live in Singapore. This github is where I keep track of various codes I've written - usually when attempting to learn a new language.

I've had some experience coding with Python, Java, Javascript and C. Currently, I'm improving my Python skills, and learning how to hack (ethically).

I learn primarily from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/natasha-tan-6/) courses.
